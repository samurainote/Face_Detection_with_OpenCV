## Introduction

Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to find and visualize human faces in digital images. This technology is a special case of object detection technology that deals with the detection of instances of objects on the semantics of certain classes of digital images and videos (humans, buildings, cars, etc.). With the advent of technology, face detection has become very important, especially in the fields of photography, security and marketing.
